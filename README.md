# TerraGuard

## üöÄ What It Does

TerraGuard is a cloud security automation tool that:

- Imports cloud configurations and scans for security misconfigurations.
- Runs static security tests using **tfsec** to detect issues in Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- Uses **AI-powered debugging**, providing intelligent suggestions and fixes instead of just reporting errors.
